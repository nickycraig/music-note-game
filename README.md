## Music Note Match Game!
This game incorporates images of notes on the treble staff and bass staff, 26 in total (middle C up to high A for treble, low E up to middle C for bass), with clickable buttons ABCDEFG to correspond with the note displayed. Correct/incorrect answers will be kept track of in the sidebar scoreboard, and when the player decides to start a new round, the previous round's score will be logged below the current score.

# Usage
At this time, the game is primarily intended as an educational tool to help music students drill their note-reading skills.

# Future modifications
3 versions of game play: just treble notes, just bass notes, and a mix of treble and bass, incorporating notes with ledger lines above and below the staves.

A round timer: where the user has to see how many correct notes they can get in an allotted time; maybe there could be 30 and 60 second timers–what’s your highest score achieved in the given amount of time?

Reverse of game play: the note letter is given and the user must match to a card in a group of let’s say 3-5 note images.

All of the above using alto and tenor clefs--treble and bass would be the most useful for kids and others just starting out learing to play most instruments, but alto and tenor could be useful for more advanced music theory students and those who are learning to play instruments like viola, cello, bassoon, etc.
